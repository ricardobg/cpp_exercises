In this exercise your program receives two lists of integers. 
You need to return the position (starting at 0) of the two lists where the two lists became the same. 

The lists can repeat values and the portion where they are equal are of the same size.
For example:
1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6

Should return:
0
